# Max-Min-Program-in-Python-
((SDEV 300 Lab 1)) 


This is a python program that finds the Min and Max of 5 integers only use the functionality and Python concepts covered so far in the readings and examples. For example, we have not covered loops, arrays or else if statement. We are limited to simple if statements, print, input, mathematical operators, comparison operators and a few other introductory concepts.

We build these other concepts very quickly over the next couple of weeks.

You should also begin to use the PEP Python Style guide mentioned in the book and found here:

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

Some examples of Python Coding Style best practices include:

Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.

Imports are always put at the top of the file, just after any module comments and before module globals and constants.

Use 4 spaces for indentation.
